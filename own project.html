  <h2 class="title">ANUBIS NEW MAP</h2>

  <p class="info"><img src="https://cdn1.dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18152134/csgo-anubis.jpg" width="500" class="screen"><br>
    Today’s update includes an adjustment to the Active Duty map pool as well as some weapon adjustments.
  </p>

  <p class="info">For starters, we’re making changes to the Active Duty map pool, which will determine which maps get played at the 2023 Paris Major.<br>

    <strong>Anubis</strong> is being added to Active <strong>Duty and Dust II</strong> is being removed. But both maps are still available in <em></em>Casual, Deathmatch, and Competitive modes.</em><br>

    We’re also making some adjustments to weapons. The AWP has had its magazine size reduced to five bullets (so make them count!), and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long ranges.<br>

    Try the changes out and let us know what you think!</p>
